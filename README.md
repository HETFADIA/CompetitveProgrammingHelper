## About The Project

<p>You can create Random Arrays, Random Permutations, Primes, PrimesCount, NextPrimes, PreviousPrimes, Prime Factors of Numbers in a Given Range, Approx Time for a program etc using this project.</p>
<p>The Generated output can be used to test a code, hack a code, debug a code easily and in no time.</p>
<p>The output can also determine the time the code would take when submitted so that we can determine whether it is TLE or not.</p>

## Instructions on How to Run

<p>Go to the github pages link</p>
<p>Enter the numbers or array size in the input boxes</p>
<p>The input boxes automatically evaluates the input.</p>
<p>Click on Generate button to generate the output(arrays or permutations or prime factors).</p>
<p>Click on clear button to reset the generated output.</p>

## Evaluation of the input

The program automatically evaluates the input.

- `10` Evaluated as 10
- `1e7` Evaluated as 10000000
- `2*10*3/2` Evaluated as its value ie. 30
- `pow(10,5)` Evaluated as 100000
- `sqrt(100)` Evaluated as 10
- `cbrt(1000)` Evaluated as 10
- `log(1000)` Evaluated as Math.log(1000)=6.9
- `log2(1000)` Evaluated as Math.log2(1000)=9.96
- `log10(1000)` Evaluated as Math.log10(1000)=3
- `exp(3)` Evaluated as e raised to 3= 20.08
- `pi` Evaluated as pi(pi or PI both works here)
- `e` Evaluated as e ie 2.73
- `pi*e` Evaluated as pi into e
- `sin(1)` Evaluated as sin of 1 radian
- `cos(1)` Evaluated as cos of 1 radian
- `tan(1)` Evaluated as tan of 1 radian
<p>
  Many other expressions are also evaluated by writing Math.atan, Math.acos etc.

## Algorithms used

Sieve Of Erantosthenes: Sieve is used to find whether Integers in a large interval are prime or not.

Sieve Prime Factorization(spf): SPF is used in the prime factorization of integers in a large interval.

The Program automatically detects whether SPF and Sieve can fasten the code. If they can save time using them then Sieve or SPF are used respectively.
